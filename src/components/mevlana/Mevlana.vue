                        <p>
                            Mevlana Rumi's teachings became the foundation of the Mevlevi Order, also known as the Whirling
                            Dervishes. This Sufi order practices a form of mystical dance called Sama, symbolizing the
                            spiritual journey of seeking union with the divine. The Mevlevi Order continues to exist today,
                            carrying forward the legacy of Mevlana Rumi.
